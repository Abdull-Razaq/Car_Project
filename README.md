# Car_Project

- This is a car finder project that aims to make the process of buying a car easier and more convenient for users.

# The Problem statement:

- Finding a car to buy in Kenya can be a bit tiresome. Showrooms and car brokers often lack a central location where car buyers can interact and find their ideal car.

# Solution

- The solution to this problem is a website that allows users to view a variety of cars and choose from them from the comfort of their homes without having to struggle to go to showrooms and car brokers.

- As a user, I want to be able to update car details
- As a user, I want to be able to delete a car listing
